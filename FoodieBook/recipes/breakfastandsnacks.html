<h2>Dosa</h2>


<img class="recipe-image" src="../images/dosa.jpg">
<h4>Ingredients : </h4>
<p>
Raw rice-1 cup <br>
Idli rice-1 cup <br>
Urad dal-1/2 cup <br>
Toor dal-3 tblsp <br>
Channa dal-3 tblsp <br>
flattened rice-1/4 cup <br>
Salt as needed 
</p>
<p class="desc">
Soak everything except salt in the ingredients together for 3 hours atleast after washing it 3 times.Grind it with little water in mixie. Need not be too smooth. Add water very carefully. You can grind in two batches and add salt in one batch and mix it lastly together. Keep overnight for fermentation (12 hours). It will ferment well. Morning stir well and make dosas. Adjust consistency if its too thick by adding very little water.Heat tawa, pour 2 ladles full of batter and  spread evenly. Then drizzle enough oil over it and cook until its golden in medium flame.  No need to flip.

<h2>Idli</h2>


<img class="recipe-image" src="../images/idli.jpg" >
<h4>Ingredients : </h4>
<p>
<br>Raw rice-1 cup <br>
Idli rice-1 cup<br> 
Urad dal-3/4 cup <br>
Fenugreek seeds-1 tsp<br> 
Salt as needed 
</p>
<p class="desc">
Soak urad dal & fenugreek seeds, rice as we soak for the regular idli. You can soak together and grind too, I have tried both ways, but I prefer soaking separately and grinding separately as I do for the regular idli. This way it comes out really good with full flavour. If you are comfortable soaking together and grinding, then you can do so, but the texture comes a bit denser than grinding separately. Either way, grind it coarsely.Mix and keep in a large vessel overnight for fermentation.This makes easy for taking out the idli after steaming. You should grease the vessel as well. Pour batter to it, say 1 & 1/2 inches height.Steam for 15 to 20 mins until the tooth pick (or a knife) inserted comes out clean. Let it be for a minute aside and invert in a clean platform. You can run a knife through the sides to make it easy for the idli to come out when you invert.
